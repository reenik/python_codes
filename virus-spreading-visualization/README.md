# Simulating viral outbreaks

In this project, we simulate a viral outbreak using [matplotlib animation](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/api/animation_api.html). We created the simulation specifically for the novel coronavirus that causes [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/), then we used this simulation to compare various outbreaks that have occured in the past century.
