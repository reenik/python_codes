# Mapping Megxit: Where folks are talking about Harry and Meghan

In this project, we use the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/) to identify and illustrate where in the world people are gossiping about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which is to say Prince Harry and Megan Markle.

In another project, we use the Twitter API to automatically generate tweets to our Internet service provider whenever upload/download speeds fall below their advertised rates.
