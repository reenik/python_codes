We explore time-series analysis using a recurrent neural network called long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the closing price for shares of Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA).

You will find the same code rendered in two different formats: standard python file (.py) and Jupiter Notebook (.ipynb). Use whichever is most familiar to you.
