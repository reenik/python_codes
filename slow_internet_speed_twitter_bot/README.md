# Using Twitter API to automatically Tweet Comcast complaints

In this project, we automate tests for whether our upload and download speeds match those advertised by our internet-service provider (ISP). When connection speeds fall below some threshold of advertised speeds, we use [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en) to generate Tweets complaining of poor service.

We even got Comcast to respond to our bot!

In another video, we use Twitter API to identify which parts of the world were Tweeting most about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
