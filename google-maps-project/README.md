# Automating WFH requests with Google Maps Platform

In this project, we use [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)'s [Distance Metrix API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/routes/) to calculate our commute time, and when there's too much traffic, we use a bot to automate work-from-home (WFH) requests to our boss.
