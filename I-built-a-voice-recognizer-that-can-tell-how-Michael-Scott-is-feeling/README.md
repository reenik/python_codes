In this project, we use a pretrained neural network to classify the emotional states of characters from the hit TV show, The Office.

We explore signal processing of audio data, using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to represent the audio waveform, which serves as the basis for our model's predictions.

We use a slightly modified version of the pretrained convolutional neural network developed by Mitesh Puthran ([@MITESHPUTHRANNEU](https://github.com/MITESHPUTHRANNEU)) called the Speech-Emotion-Analyzer.
